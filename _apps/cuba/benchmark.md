        <p>The benchmark programs used in our paper can be found on <a href="https://github.com/lpzun/cuba/tree/pldi/examples/pldi18.bm">GitHub</a>.
          They are in the directory<code>examples/pldi18.bm</code> if you checked out the whole artifact from Github.
        </p>
        <p>
            We don't include the <code>.spec</code> for most <i>safe</i> benchmarks as CUBA anyway
            computes the full reachability for them.

We have applied the Observation Sequence paradigm to the undecidable problem of analyzing reachability for concurrent procedures communicating via global-scope variables [PLDI 2018](https://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi-2018). Our technique is dubbed CUBA (Context-UnBounded Analysis).


We have also applied this paradigm to unbounded-queue message passing systems written in the P language, such as distributed communication protocols [CAV 2019](http://i-cav.org/2019/). Our technique is dubbed QUBA (Queue-UnBounded Analysis). Details are shown on the left.
